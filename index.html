                <br>
                <p> On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files.
                    (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web server connects to the Internet
                    and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, 
                     this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser
                     uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through 
                     the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

                 <p>
                    The primary Windows platform for running Apache 2.4 is Windows 2000 or later. Always obtain and install the current service pack to avoid operating system bugs.

                    Apache HTTP Server versions later than 2.2 will not run on any operating system earlier than Windows 2000.

                 <p>
                    Apache is the web server that processes requests and serves web assets and content via HTTP.
                     MySQL is the database that stores all your information in an easily queried format.    
                     PHP is the programming language that works with apache to help create dynamic web content.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software.
                     However, WordPress can run on other web server software as well.

                 <p>
                    The goal behind NGINX was to create the fastest web server around, and maintaining that excellence is still a central 
                    goal of the project. NGINX consistently beats Apache and other servers in benchmarks measuring web server performance. 
                    Since the original release of NGINX, however, websites have expanded from simple HTML pages to dynamic, multifaceted content.
                    NGINX has grown along with it and now supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2,
                    gRPC, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP, and others).

                    Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license.
                    Operating system	BSD variants, HP-UX, IBM AIX, Linux, macOS, Solaris, Microsoft Windows, and other *nix flavors
                    Type	Web server, reverse/mail proxy server
                    License	2-clause BSD

                 <h2 class ="titleText">Caddy Web Server Operating System Requirements</h2><br>
                 <p>
                    Caddy is the only web server that uses HTTPS by default. 
                    As its primary mode of configuration, Caddy's REST API makes it easy to automate and integrate with your apps. 
                    No Dependencies. Because Caddy is written in Go, its binaries are entirely self-contained and run on every platform,
                    including containers without libc.

                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <p>
                    What OS does Caddy run on?

                    Operating system	BSD variants, Linux, Plan 9, macOS and Windows
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <h2 class ="titleText">Programming Language (software) Compatibility </h2><br>
                 <p>
                   Most people use Caddy as a web server or proxy, but at its core, Caddy is a server of servers. With the requisite modules, it can take on the role of any long-running process!

                   Configuration is both dynamic and exportable with Caddy's API. Although no config files required, you can still use them; most people's favorite way of configuring Caddy is using the Caddyfile. The format of the config document takes many forms with config adapters, but Caddy's native config language is JSON.

                   Caddy compiles for all major platforms and has no runtime dependencies.
